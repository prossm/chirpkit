# - Applies data augmentation (60% probability)
# - Uses cosine annealing learning rate scheduling
# - Implements early stopping (patience: 15 epochs)
# - Logs comprehensive metrics to TensorBoard
# - Saves detailed classification reports every 10 epochs
```

### Evaluation
```bash
# Comprehensive model evaluation
python scripts/evaluate_model.py

# Generates:
# - Confusion matrix visualization
# - Per-class accuracy plots  
# - ROC curves for all classes
# - Detailed classification reports
```

### Validation Pipeline
```bash
# Complete model validation and testing
python scripts/validate_pipeline.py

# Tests:
# - Model consistency across runs
# - Data augmentation diversity
# - Model robustness to noise
# - Training data quality and distribution
```
